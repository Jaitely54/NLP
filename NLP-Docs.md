## **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

# ***What is NLP ?***
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP allows computers to communicate with people using everyday language and perform tasks like translation, spell check, or even chatting with users.



# ***Basic Terminologies in NLP***
**1.) Corpus:**- This is a large and structured set of texts, collection of multiple documents in a dataset, here documents can be a text or audio format.</br>
**2.) Documents:**-  A text object, A collection which makes up your corpus. In other words the collections of words which form a sentence in a paragraph.</br>
**3.) Vocabulary:**- A set of Unique words in the dictionary or a dataset.</br>
**4.) Word:**- Collection of alphabets, i.e word.</br>
**5.) Tokenization:**- This is the process of breaking down a text into smaller parts, such as words or sentences. Each of these smaller parts is called a "token." For example, the sentence "I love cookies" would be broken into the tokens "I," "love," and "cookies."</br>
**6.) Lexicon:**- A lexicon is like a dictionary. Itâ€™s a collection of words and their meanings. In NLP, a lexicon usually refers to the vocabulary of a language paired with additional information, such as the part of speech or the tense of each word.</br>
**7.) Syntax:**- This refers to the arrangement of words in a sentence to make grammatical sense. NLP uses syntax to analyze how sentences are structured, which helps the computer understand the role of each word.</br>
**8.) Semantics:**- This involves the meaning of words and sentences. NLP uses semantic analysis to understand the meanings behind what words convey in different contexts.</br>
**9.) Stop words:**- Stop words are words that are filtered out before processing natural language data (text). These are usually the most common words in a language, such as "and", "the", "a", "an", and "in". </br>
**10.) Stemming:**- Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its base or root form. The main purpose of stemming is to standardize words to their base form in order to facilitate comparison between different forms of the same word. For example, the stem of the words "running", "runner", and "ran" is "run".</br> 
**11.) Root Words:**- Root Words (often called lemmas) are the original dictionary form of a word. As opposed to stemming, the process of lemmatization looks beyond word reduction and considers a language's full vocabulary to apply a morphological analysis to words.</br>
**12.) Part-of-Speech Tagging(POS):**- This is the process of labeling each word in a sentence as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. This helps the computer to understand the role of each word in the sentence.</br>
